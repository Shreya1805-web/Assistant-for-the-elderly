## How is it different from following a video tutorial or asking help from Google Assitant?
<p>Google assistant will direct you to a proper webpage where the instructions are to be found. For people using modern smartphones, even following the instructions on the webpage and replicating them in your phone might be difficult. Also, these instructions often assume that the user knows certain things and thus might not explain evry step in great detail.</p>
<p>Coming to video tutorials, they might give a visualisation of the process, but they don't wait for the user to complete a step and confirm the same. Also, in most cases it's seen that the people who are new to these apps themselves don't know why they might not be able to log in or use a feature. In such cases this bot can guide them through each small step, identify their problems and help them solve it.</p>
